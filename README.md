Part 1: The 'I have no idea what I am doing' phase

The plan for this project is to build a landing website for a fictional mega corporation from a game called Perfect Dark on the Nintendo64. The corporation has a vast research department and weapons program. 

The plan is to design something sleak with good menu functionality, a parallax effect on one (or more) of the pages, good scalability and of course some javascript features. I will also include a hamburger menu for mobile, because I hear hamburgers are pretty tasty these days. The first phase will be to build a basic, clean website with the navigation bar built in, with links to the extra pages for some of the products.

I have found that commenting out for organization helps my thought process with things, so expect a LOT of comments. 

Part 2: Navigation bar is complete 

Next I want to build the index, copy the footer and possibly some other content over to the other pages to get them rolling. After I'm satisfied with the index, I want to start implementing some cool stuff on each page to hit the project requirements. 

I got a little off-track exploring new things. I decided to change up the layout I was going for a bit because I found these really cool 3d models that I could embed into the page, so I want to build a gallery on the featured page. So far it seems cool. On the individual pages, I will have info sections for the products in the main-nav bar, with some parallax stuff. Next task is gonna be to add a footer and some kind of prompt / input field for email newsletter, and add some javascript if the @ symbol or .com isn't detected.
