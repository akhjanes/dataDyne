Part 1: The 'I have no idea what I am doing' phase

The plan for this project is to build a landing website for a fictional mega corporation from a game called Perfect Dark on the Nintendo64. The corporation has a vast research department and weapons program. 

The plan is to design something sleak with good menu functionality, a parallax effect on one (or more) of the pages, good scalability and of course some javascript features. I will also include a hamburger menu for mobile, because I hear hamburgers are pretty tasty these days. The first phase will be to build a basic, clean website with the navigation bar built in, with links to the extra pages for some of the products.

I have found that commenting out everything for organization helps my thought process with things, so expect a LOT of comments.
