we totally didnt get alien technology from the skedar 

The plan for this project is to build a landing website for a fictional mega corporation from a game called Perfect Dark on the Nintendo64. The corporation has a vast research department and weapons program. 

I want to build something sleak with good menu functionality, a parallax effect on one of the pages, good scalability and of course some javascript features. 

The first phase will be to build a basic, clean website with the navigation bar built in, with links to the extra pages for some of the products.
